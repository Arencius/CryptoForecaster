A simple application that allows you to see how cryptocurrency prices have evolved over the last 365 days. Furthermore, the application uses the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) forecasting model in order to predict and display on the chart the expected range of values of these currencies over the next 3 months (at the estimated confidence level of 95%). GUI made in TKinter.
